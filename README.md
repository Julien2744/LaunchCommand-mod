In Vanilla Minecraft the main way to modify entity motion is with /data, and you are not allowed to modify player data.

This mod is here to remove this limit with 1 singular command !

## How to use

- `/launch <entities> addMotion <motionX> <motionY> <motionZ>` : will add motion to the target(s)
  
- `/launch <entities> setMotion <motionX> <motionY> <motionZ>` : will set the motion to the target(s)
  
- `/launch <entities> looking <force>` : will add motion to the target(s) depending on the `force` argument and the rotation of the source (who executed the command)

## Other informations
